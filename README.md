# rainfall-prediction
🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Project
📌 Overview 
This project predicts precipitation levels using the historical weather data of Austin, Texas. We use Linear Regression to model relationships between weather features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the target variable "PrecipitationSumInches"
✅ Objective
Clean and preprocess the dataset
-Handle symbols like "T"(Trace) and "-"(missing)
-Train a Linear Regression model
-Visualize relationships and trends
-Evaluate prediction performance
🔍 Key Insights
-The model shows moderate predictive power.
-Features like humidity, dew point, and visibility are more correlated with rainfall.
-Precipitation is complex and may require advanced models for better accuracy.
